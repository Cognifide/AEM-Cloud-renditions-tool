# AEM Cloud renditions tool

This is a tool that reads the Processing Profile configuration and generates the same Asset renditions in local environment as AEM as a Cloud Service environment would generate.

The code of this project is a result of following a tutorial, that is available on Wunderman Thompson Technology [Tech Blog](https://wttech.blog/blog/2020/handling-aem-as-a-cloud-service-renditions-in-local-development/).

# AEM Cloud renditions tool

This is a tool that reads the Processing Profile configuration and generates the same Asset renditions in local environment as AEM as a Cloud Service environment would generate.

The code of this project is a result of following a tutorial, that will soon be available on Cognifide's [Tech Blog](https://tech.cognifide.com/blog/).
